# Signal Denoised Filter - Matlab
 
 
 ### What is filter? 
 We work on signal processing,so in signal processing, a filter is a mechanism that eliminates any unnecessary components or features from the signal.
 
Filtering is a class of signal processing, the filter concept being the total or partial suppression of any component of the signal. 
Almost all of the time, this involves eliminating certain frequency or frequency bands. However, filters do not work solely in the frequency domain; several other filtering objectives occur particularly in image processing.
